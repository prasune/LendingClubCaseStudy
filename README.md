## General Information
- Background
Lending Club is the largest online loan marketplace. AtLending Club, Borrowers can easily access lower interest rate loans through a fast online interface.
When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:

* If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
* If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company

We need to reduce loan to risky applicants to avoid financial loss to the company.
